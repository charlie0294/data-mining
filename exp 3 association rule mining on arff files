Aim: Apply association rule mining on ARFF files using WEKA.
Theory: Association rule learning is a type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for
the dependency of one data item on another data item and maps accordingly so that it can be
more profitable. It tries to find some interesting relations or associations among the variables
of dataset. It is based on different rules to discover the interesting relations between variables
in the database.
About the Dataset Used:
Supermarket Dataset (supermarket.arff)
o Description: A dataset containing transactional records of a supermarket, used for
association rule mining.
o Instances: 4627
o Attributes: 217 (Each attribute represents a product, indicating whether it was purchased in
a transaction.)
o Data Type: Binary (1 for purchased, 0 for not purchased)
o Use Case: Market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm to find associations between
frequently bought products.
Steps:
Step 1: In the WEKA explorer, open the Preprocess tab, click on the Open file ... button and
select supermarket.arff database from the installation folder
The database contains 4627 instances and 217 attributes. In order to identify the association
between such a large number of attributes, this task is automated with the help of Apriori
algorithm.
Step 2: Click on the Associate TAB and click on the Choose button. Select the Apriori
association.
Step 3: To set the parameters for the Apriori algorithm, click on its name. A window will pop
up that allows us to set the parameters:
Output:
At the bottom, weâ€™ll find the identified best rules of associations that will help the supermarket
in stocking their products in appropriate shelves.
