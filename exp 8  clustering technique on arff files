Aim: Implementation of clustering technique on ARFF files using WEKA.
Theory:
Cluster Analysis in Data Mining means that to find out the group of objects which are similar
to each other in the group but are different from the object in other groups. In the process of
clustering in data analytics, the sets of data are divided into groups or classes based on data
similarity.
About the Dataset Used:
Iris Dataset (iris.arff)
o Description: A well-known dataset used for classification and clustering tasks.
o Instances: 150
o Attributes:
• Sepal length (Numeric)
• Sepal width (Numeric)
• Petal length (Numeric)
• Petal width (Numeric)
o Class label (Nominal) – Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica
o Use Case: Visualization, Clustering, and Classification.
Steps:
Step 1: In the preprocessing interface, Load iris.arff dataset.
Step 2: Find the ‘cluster’ tab in the explorer and press the choose button to execute clustering.
A dropdown list of available clustering algorithms appears as a result of this step and selects
the simple-k means algorithm.
Step 3: Then, to the right of the choose icon, press the text button to bring up the popup window
shown below. We enter three for the number of clusters in this window and leave the seed value
alone. The seed value is used to generate a random number that is used to make internal
assignments of instances of clusters.
Step 4: One of the choices has been chosen. We must ensure that they are in the ‘cluster mode’
panel before running the clustering algorithm. The choice to use a training set is selected, and
then the ‘start’ button is pressed.
Step 5: The centroid of each cluster is shown in the result window, along with statistics on the
number and percent of instances allocated to each cluster. Each cluster centroid is represented
by a mean vector. This cluster can be used to describe a cluster.
