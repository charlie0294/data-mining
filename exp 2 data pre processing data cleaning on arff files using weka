Aim: Perform data pre-processing including cleaning, integration, and transformation on
ARFF files using WEKA.
Theory:
Data preprocessing is an important step in the data mining process. It refers to the cleaning,
transforming, and integrating of data in order to make it ready for analysis. The goal of data
preprocessing is to improve the quality of the data and to make it more suitable for the specific
data mining task.
• Data Cleaning: This involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the
data, such as missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Various techniques can be used
for data cleaning, such as imputation, removal, and transformation.
• Data Integration: This involves combining data from multiple sources to create a
unified dataset. Data integration can be challenging as it requires handling data with
different formats, structures, and semantics. Techniques such as record linkage and data
fusion can be used for data integration.
• Data Transformation: This involves converting the data into a suitable format for
analysis. Common techniques used in data transformation include normalization,
standardization, and discretization. Normalization is used to scale the data to a common
range, while standardization is used to transform the data to have zero mean and unit
variance. Discretization is used to convert continuous data into discrete categories.
About the Dataset Used:
Weather Dataset (weather-nominal.arff & weather-numeric.arff)
o Description: A small dataset used for classification problems, mainly in weather prediction
and decision-making.
o Instances: 14
o Attributes:
• Outlook (Nominal) – sunny, overcast, rainy
• Temperature (Numeric/Nominal) – hot, mild, cold
• Humidity (Numeric/Nominal) – high, normal
• Windy (Boolean) – true, false
• Play (Boolean) – yes, no (Target variable)
o Use Case: Classification and Data Preprocessing.
Steps:
To perform Data Preprocessing, we will use the Weather database that is provided in the
installation.
Step 1: Using the Open file option under the Preprocess tag, select the weather- nominal.arff
file.

Step 2: When you open the file, your screen looks like as shown below.
Step 3: Let us understand the Data. The highlighted Current relation sub window shows the
name of the database that is currently loaded. Also, there are 14 instances i.e., the number of
rows in the table and there 5 attributes - the fields in the table. On the left side, an Attributes
sub window is present that displays the various fields in the database.
Step 4: The weather database contains five fields - outlook, temperature, humidity, windy and
play. After selecting an attribute from this list by clicking on it, further details on the attribute
itself are displayed on the right.
After clicking on the temperature attribute first, we would see the screen below:
In the Selected Attribute subwindow, you can observe the following −
• The name and the type of the attribute are displayed.
• The type for the temperature attribute is Nominal.
• The number of Missing values is zero.
• There are three distinct values with no unique value.
• The table underneath this information shows the nominal values for this field as hot,
mild and cold.
• It also shows the count and weight in terms of a percentage for each nominal value.
Step 5: At the bottom of the window, we can see the visual representation of the class values.
After selecting the Visualize All button, we would be able to see all features in one single
window as shown below:
Step 6: Removing Attributes- Many a time, the data that we use for model building comes with
many irrelevant fields. To remove Attribute(s) select them and click on the Remove button at
the bottom. The selected attributes would be removed from the database. After you fully
preprocess the data, we can save it for model building.
Step 7: Applying Filters- To illustrate the use of filters, we will use weather- numeric.arff
database that contains two numeric attributes - temperature and humidity. We will convert these
to nominal by applying a filter on our raw data. Click on the Choose button in the Filter subwindow and select the following filter:
weka→filters→supervised→attribute→Discretize
Click on the Apply button and examine the temperature and/or humidity attribute. We would
notice that these have changed from numeric to nominal types.
Let us look into another filter now. Suppose we want to select the best attributes for deciding
the play. Select and apply the following filter:
weka→filters→supervised→attribute→AttributeSelection
The temperature and humidity attributes from the database are removed.
