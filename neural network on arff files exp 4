Aim: Implementation of Neural Network technique on ARFF files using WEKA
Theory: A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying
relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.
In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.
About the Dataset Used:
Weather Dataset (weather-nominal.arff & weather-numeric.arff)
o Description: A small dataset used for classification problems, mainly in weather prediction
and decision-making.
o Instances: 14
o Attributes:
• Outlook (Nominal) – sunny, overcast, rainy
• Temperature (Numeric/Nominal) – hot, mild, cold
• Humidity (Numeric/Nominal) – high, normal
• Windy (Boolean) – true, false
• Play (Boolean) – yes, no (Target variable)
o Use Case: Classification and Data Preprocessing.
Steps:
Step 1: Open Weka and open file weather
Step 2: Click classify then choose function Multilayer perceptron
Step 3: Choose test options use training set and start
Step 4: Change GUI true and press start
Step 5: Change hidden layers numbers
